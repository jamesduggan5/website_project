	  <h3><u>Hosts Background!</u><br>
		  </h3>
      <p>Founded in 2018 by 2 college students who were known as good party hosts in college. They took it upon themselves to organise a rave in an abandoned warehouse in Galway. These 2 students then moved to Ibiza when they finished their studies and continued to host the festival there. Their main mission is to give local Irish talent exposure on the largest stage of the world. It has proved a huge success and it shows how talented the local irish talent really.<figure><img src="images/Galway.jpeg" width="40%" height="80%" alt=""/>
