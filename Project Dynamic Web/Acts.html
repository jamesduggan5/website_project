  <u> KETTAMAÂ  </u><br>
  
  The headline DJ has been making traction worldwide after just finishing up an Australian tour. Hailing from Galway this DJ is well known in the local circuit as he has been playing local Galway clubs for years. Having played festivals such as hideout and Electric picnic shows how well regarded he is in the house/techno scene. And we also felt this festival needed a well known face to represent Galway on Global Stage!(<a href="https://soundcloud.com/kettamabro" target="_blank">Try Kettama&rsquo;s music!</a>)
